👋 Hi, I’m Logan Gibb
👀 I’m interested in computer vision, deep learning, and image-based materials analysis.
🌱 I’m a Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering at the University of Utah, focusing on morphological signatures of uranium oxides using CNNs.
💼 I work with SEM/XRD data, ResNet-based models, and materials informatics.
💞️ I’m open to collaborations in nuclear forensics, materials characterization, and AI/ML for scientific applications.
